# twiggle (second pass)

## Introduction

twiggle is a word game.  The player uses a set of seven letters to make as many words as possible.  One of the seven letters is designated the key letter and every word made must use that letter at least once.  All letters may be used multiple times in a given word.  Proper nouns, acronyms, hyphenated words and contractions are not valid answers.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

When I started learning to code I knew I would want to create a game like this.  After I got the first version working I immediately began planning this version. 

## Unsolved Problems

The game is not mobile responsive.  I'll address this in the next version.    

## Future Enhancements

I would like to have a database of puzzle sets of varying difficulty.  The user will choose a difficulty level (Easier, Harder or Ridiculous) and then be presented with a puzzle that matches the choice.
